<p> There will come a day, much quicker than your parents would wish,</p>
<p> when you will no longer be comfortable living at home.</p>
<p> You will want to move out and establish a home of your own.</p>
<p> After that time, your mother and father will be more like your friends than your parents.</p>
<p> And someday, if they live long enough, you will be more like a parent to them than a son or daughter</p>
